Hi everyone, 

I'm Mahesh and thrilled to be a part of the GitHub community. As a developer, I'm deeply passionate about two programming languages in particular - Java and Angular. I'm always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and expertise in these areas, and I love collaborating with others who share my interests.

Currently, I'm focused on learning Java and Angular multi-module to further broaden my skill set. I believe that continuous learning is essential for staying on top of the latest trends and technologies in the ever-evolving world of software development.

I'm excited to connect with other like-minded individuals on GitHub and open to collaborating on interesting projects that align with my interests. Feel free to contact me at maheshshinde54 and let's discuss how we can work together to create something great.
